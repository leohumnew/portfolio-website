## Details
Needing to update my old WordPress website, I created this one from scratch in pure HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. It follows a mobile-first, accessible design approach, and I have taken special interest in trying to shorten load times and improve SEO quality.

It uses a couple of components from the Parallax and Metro 4 libraries, although I plan to remove both dependencies as soon as Safari adds a couple of specific modern CSS elements...
It also includes a contact form that uses PHP to avoid exposing the email address being used.
