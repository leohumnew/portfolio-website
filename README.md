# Portfolio Website
Needing to update my old WordPress website, I created this one from scratch in pure HTML, CSS, and PHP. It follows a mobile-first, accessible design approach, while doing everything possible to shorten load times and improve SEO quality. It uses some components from the Parallax and Metro 4 libraries, although I plan to remove both dependencies as soon as Safari adds a couple of specific modern CSS elements...
